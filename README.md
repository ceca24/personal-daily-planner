## Description and Usage

In this bootcamp challenge, students were tasked with modifying a starter code to create an application that creates a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This is a basic day planner app that loops through the hours of 9am - 5pm for a specific date (current date). The app uses moment.js to handle time. The app allows the user to enter and save text into any description field that has a class of future. The data will be saved to the localStorage of the browser. The past hours are highlighted gray, the current hour red, and future hours green.
